<h1> Bookshop </h1>

A simple bookshop design with dynamic features. 

<h2> Project Overview </h2>

Crafted using Html5, Css and JavaScript, this project offers a range of book categories including history, novel, finance, children's literature, self-development and science which you can sort through. This interface empowers users to tailor their shopping experience seamlessly before proceeding to checkout.

<h2> Technologies Used </h2> </br>

<ul>

<li> HTML5 </li> </br>

<li> CSS </li> </br>

<li> JavaScript </li> </br>

<h2> Features </h2>

<ul>

<li> Toggle Modal </li> </br>

This allows users to easily open and close the menu by clicking on a toggle button or icon.

<li> Fetch-Then-Catch </li> </br>

Using this feature, I brought the booklist over and fetched all the books without having to use json parse or appendChild as extra features.

<li> Star Rating  </li> </br>

With for cycle and return feature, I created dynamic star ratings for each book based on user reviews or ratings. This allows users to visually assess the quality or popularity of books at a glance.

<li> forEach Functionality </li> </br>

Utilizing this method I made calculations such as multiplying product price by item quantity so the user could see the price accordingly. 

<li> Increase, decrease, reduce </li> </br>

This ensures a smooth user experience by allowing users to adjust the quantity of items before checkout. Reduce method allows the calculation of the total price of items in the basket based on their quantities and individual prices. 

<li> Remove </li> </br>

Last but not least, with this feature, users can easily remove unwanted items from their basket and adjust their selections before proceeding to checkout. 

</ul>
